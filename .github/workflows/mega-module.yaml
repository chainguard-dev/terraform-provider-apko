  # WARNING: This is mattmoor being a bit *too* clever.
  # We want to be able to test the reproducibility of things via the upstream
  # check-reproducibility test, which requires ambient credentials, but those
  # are only available to pull requests under two circumstances:
  #  1. The trigger is `pull_request_target`, and
  #  2. The pull request is from a branch on the main repo.
  # However, this doesn't cause things to fail when the pull request is from a
  # fork, it will just make the tf-cosign rules NOPs and the
  # check-repoducibility skip.
  #
  # But why not just use pull_request_target?
  # This is because to pull in breaking changes to apko, we will need to update
  # our apko Go dependency and the APKO_IMAGE (below) in the same PR, and the
  # latter cannot be checked with the former if the workflow is
  # pull_request_target.
  #
  # All of that said, dependabot and digestabot PRs come from branches on the
  # main repo, so the net effect of this SHOULD be that we get an error
  # presubmit when digestabot wants to pull in an update that is not
  # reproducible with the version of the apko Go library we depend on.
